Hi! My name is Alan and I'm a full stack web developer from London.

I love learning and playing with new technologies, and where I can, teaching people how best to use them. You can find examples of my code at [Github](http://www.github.com/alol).

When not developing, I like to bake, go to shows and play board games.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to email me at [alan@alol.co.uk](alan@alol.co.uk), or on [twitter](http://twitter.com/alol).
